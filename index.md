## About Me

I am an AI Researcher at Lumir Inc. (Military Service), working on computer vision and remote sensing applications. I received my M.S. in Artificial Intelligence from Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology (<a href="https://aigs.unist.ac.kr/web/index.php">UNIST</a>) in 2023, where I worked on improving reference-based super-resolution in remote sensing via domain matching under the supervision of <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/jaejunyoo/professor">Prof. Jaejun Yoo</a>, and my B.S. in Computer Science and Engineering from Kyungpook National University in 2021.

My research focuses on inverse problems in computer vision, particularly super-resolution and cross-view retrieval, as well as multi-modal remote sensing (EO & SAR). I also build LLM-based agents for computer vision and InSAR/D-InSAR processing.

## Research Interests

- **Computer Vision:** Super-resolution (RefSR, Blind SR, SISR), Denoising, Segmentation, Object Detection, Generative AI (GAN, Diffusion)
- **Remote Sensing:** Multi-modal fusion (EO & SAR), Land cover classification, Cross-view retrieval, Domain adaptation
- **LLM & Agents:** LangChain, LangGraph, LangServe (Building agents for Computer Vision and InSAR/D-InSAR processing)
- **Deep Learning:** Inverse problems, Domain matching, Multi-modal learning
