## Project Overview
- **Period**: 2021.07 ~ 2023.08
- **Organization**: 인공지능(AI) 혁신 허브 사업 (MSIT)
- **Role**: Development of techniques for calibration and augmentation of space observation big data
- **Team Size**: 3

## Technical Skills
- Python (gdal)
- OpenCV
- PyTorch

## Project Description
- Introduced Reference-based Super Resolution (RefSR) into Remote Sensing Tasks
  - Leveraged the advantage of artificial satellites capable of capturing the same location from different perspectives
- Improved the performance of state-of-the-art super-resolution (SR) models
  - Overcame domain gaps through effective feature transfer
  - Implemented correspondence matching between images captured by different satellites (target) and the input (low resolution)
